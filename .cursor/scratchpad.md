# Sora Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
The Sora app allows users to download media content for offline viewing. The app includes an active downloads view and episode cells that show progress updates for ongoing downloads. The app uses notification-based updates to reflect download progress across the UI.

Currently, there's an issue where sometimes the app doesn't fully pull all data from the API, leaving blank data. We need to add retry options for blank data and implement a mechanism to stop trying after a set number of attempts.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
After examining the codebase, I've identified several points where data fetching could result in blank or missing data:

1. **API Response Handling**: The app fetches episode metadata from an external API (https://api.ani.zip/mappings) but doesn't have robust retry logic when the response is empty or when required fields are missing.

2. **No Retry Mechanism**: Currently, when a data fetch fails or returns incomplete data, there's no logic to retry the request. This can lead to blank data being displayed to the user.

3. **Incomplete Error Handling**: While there is some error handling in place (checking for nil values), there's no specific handling for cases where the API returns valid JSON but with missing episode data.

4. **Missing Max Attempts Limit**: There's no mechanism to limit retries, which could lead to infinite retry loops or excessive API calls.

5. **Data Validation**: The current code validates the structure of the JSON response but doesn't check if specific fields like titles or image URLs are empty strings.

## High-level Task Breakdown
To address these issues, we need to:

1. Implement a retry mechanism for API requests that return blank or incomplete data
2. Add a configurable maximum number of retry attempts
3. Implement exponential backoff between retries to prevent overwhelming the API
4. Add proper validation of returned data to detect blank fields
5. Update the UI to show appropriate loading states during retries
6. Add proper logging of retry attempts and failures for debugging

## Project Status Board
- [x] Add retry logic to `EpisodeMetadataManager.performFetch` method
- [x] Add retry logic to `EpisodeMetadataManager.fetchBatchFromNetwork` method
- [x] Add retry logic to `EpisodeCell.fetchAnimeEpisodeDetails` method
- [x] Implement exponential backoff between retries
- [x] Add max attempts configuration
- [x] Add validation for blank fields in API responses
- [x] Add appropriate logging for retry attempts
- [x] Build and test the implementation with various network conditions
- [x] Modify error handling to proceed with partial data rather than failing completely

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
I've successfully implemented and tested the retry mechanism with the following features:

1. Added retry logic to both the `EpisodeMetadataManager` methods that fetch data (performFetch and fetchBatchFromNetwork)
2. Added retry logic to the `EpisodeCell.fetchAnimeEpisodeDetails` method for direct API calls
3. Implemented exponential backoff using the formula `initialDelay * 2^(attempt-1)` to avoid overwhelming the API
4. Set maximum retry attempts to 3 for all fetch operations
5. Added data validation to check for blank or empty fields even when the API response structure is valid
6. Added detailed logging for retry attempts, showing the attempt number and when the next retry will occur
7. Ensured proper cleanup of resources after max retries are reached
8. Successfully built the project with no errors
9. Modified the error handling to log what specific fields are missing, but still proceed with whatever data is available

The implementation now handles various failure scenarios more gracefully:
- Network errors (no connection, timeouts)
- Missing data in valid JSON responses
- Empty fields in the API response
- Structural errors in the response

Rather than failing completely when fields are missing, the app now:
- Logs specifically what fields are missing
- Uses default values for missing fields where possible
- Proceeds with partial data rather than showing nothing at all
- Clearly indicates in logs when partial data is being used

Each retry attempt uses exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the API server, and after 3 attempts, it gives up and reports the error appropriately. All retry attempts and missing fields are logged to help with debugging.

## Lessons
- Always implement retry logic for network requests, especially in mobile apps where network conditions can be unstable.
- Use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming APIs with retry requests.
- Set a maximum number of retry attempts to prevent infinite loops.
- Validate all data returned from APIs, even if the response structure is valid.
- Log retry attempts and failures for debugging purposes.
- Cache successful responses to reduce the need for future API calls.
- Handle partial success cases, such as when batch fetching episodes and only some succeed.
- Ensure proper resource cleanup after max retries to prevent memory leaks.
- Maintain separate retry counters for different requests to handle concurrent fetching properly.
- **Graceful degradation**: Design your app to operate with degraded functionality rather than failing completely. Use whatever valid data is available rather than rejecting an entire response when only some fields are missing.
- **Detailed error logging**: When dealing with API responses, log exactly which fields are missing to help with debugging. This is more useful than generic "missing fields" errors.
- **Default values**: Always provide sensible defaults for when expected fields are missing in API responses.
- **UI resilience**: Design UI components to handle missing or incomplete data gracefully.

## Key Changes
- The `statusCheckTimer` variable has been removed from `EpisodeCell` as it's no longer needed.
- The `downloadProgress` state variable has been added to `EpisodeCell` to track download progress.
- The `downloadProgress` state variable is updated whenever a download status notification is received.
- The `downloadProgress` state variable is used to display download progress instead of directly from the `JSActiveDownload` object.
- Added a `downloadRefreshTrigger` state variable to force UI updates.
- Added ID modifiers to ensure the UI refreshes when download progress or status changes.
- Modified `EpisodeMetadataManager` and `EpisodeCell` to continue with available data when fields are missing rather than failing.
- Added logging of specific missing fields to aid in debugging.

# Episode Cell Optimization Plan

## Background and Motivation
The current implementation in `EpisodeCell.swift` has several inefficiencies in how it handles episode thumbnails and metadata:
1. Each cell makes individual network requests for metadata
2. Thumbnail images are loaded individually without proper batching
3. Cache management could be improved
4. No prefetching mechanism for upcoming episodes
5. Redundant API calls for the same episode data

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current Issues
1. **Network Inefficiency**
   - Individual API calls per episode cell
   - No request deduplication
   - No batch loading of metadata
   - Redundant network requests for same data

2. **Cache Management**
   - Basic caching implementation
   - No cache invalidation strategy
   - No cache size management

3. **User Experience**
   - Delayed loading of thumbnails and metadata
   - No indication of loading state
   - Scrolling performance issues due to network requests

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Centralize Metadata Fetching
- [x] Create a central `EpisodeMetadataManager` singleton
- [x] Implement central cache management
- [x] Add request deduplication
- [x] Support batch fetching
- [x] Add prefetching for next episodes

### Phase 2: Optimize Image Loading
- [x] Create an `ImagePrefetchManager` to handle image prefetching
- [x] Add image downsampling for thumbnails
- [x] Implement proper cache size management
- [x] Add prefetching mechanism for upcoming images
- [x] Update `EpisodeCell` to use optimized image loading

### Phase 3: Performance Monitoring
- [x] Create a performance monitoring system
- [x] Add metrics for network requests, cache hits/misses
- [x] Add memory and disk usage tracking
- [x] Integrate with existing logging system

## Project Status Board
- [x] Phase 1: Centralize Metadata Fetching
- [x] Phase 2: Optimize Image Loading
- [x] Phase 3: Performance Monitoring
- [x] Fix build errors and warnings
- [x] Successfully built the project

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
Phase 1, 2, and 3 have been completed. All components have been created and properly integrated. The project builds successfully with minor warnings that don't affect functionality.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
The implementation is now complete and the build is successful. The system now has:

1. Centralized metadata fetching with caching and prefetching
2. Optimized image loading with proper cache management and downsampling
3. Performance monitoring to track metrics for future optimization

There were some challenges with Kingfisher API compatibility that were resolved by:
1. Using the correct prefetcher initialization pattern
2. Properly handling throwing methods with do/catch blocks
3. Removing references to non-existent API methods

## Lessons
1. When working with third-party libraries like Kingfisher, always check the API documentation as methods can change between versions.
2. Use try/catch for methods that can throw exceptions.
3. Create new instances of objects like ImagePrefetcher for each batch instead of reusing a single instance.
4. Monitor build errors closely and fix each issue systematically.
5. When integrating multiple components, ensure each component can be built individually before trying to build the whole system.
